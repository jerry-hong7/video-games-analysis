## Instructions for Reproducing Results

Within this repository contains the data used for this study as well as the R script to conduct our analysis. There are two ways you can choose to reproduce our findings. 

### Downloading the files from the repository
One is by navigating to the `Code` and `Data` folders to retrieve the respective files into your computer. Next is to ensure that the script and the data files are in the same directory as well as setting the workspace directory in R to the appropriate location. Keep in mind you may need to modify the location of where the data file is being read. Another thing worth mentioning is by changing the location where the figures will be saved depending on the file locations in your computer. 

### (Preferred) Cloning the repository
The other and more efficient method is by cloning this repository into R and create a host location locally within your computer. This will allow you to run the script in its entirety without the need to make modifications to the script itself. When running the script, each of the figures created will be saved into the `Figures` folder for future reference.
